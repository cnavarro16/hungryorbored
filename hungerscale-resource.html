        <h3>Hunger and Fullness Scale</h3>
        
        <h4>Use the hunger scale</h4>
        <p>Getting familiar with our hunger cues before, during, and after eating can also help us to understand emotional eating
        at a deeper level. In the longer term, this can help with our overall health and weight loss.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that hunger is a completely natural sensation and not something to be feared. The hunger scale can help you
        to describe your level of hunger and decide when it’s best to start and stop eating throughout the day.</p>

        <p>Try to aim to be within the 3 – 6 range most of the time. Also remember to stay well hydrated, as often our body can
        mistake thirst for hunger.</p>
        
        <h4>How to use the hunger scale</h4>
        <p><h5>Before you eat</h5></p>
        <p>Before you eat something, close your eyes and focus your attention on your stomach. Try not to let the knowledge of when
        you last ate influence your decision. Instead, simply let your stomach give you a number. Your body should naturally
        feel hunger (3 on the scale) around every 3-5 hours after you eat a meal.</p>
        <p>If you notice you want to eat or you feel hungry from somewhere other than in your stomach, it might be that you’re
        eating for an emotional reason or out of habit. Instead of eating at this time, try and find an alternative way to comfort yourself.</p>
        <br>
        <p><h5>During a meal</h5></p>
        <p>Eat slowly so you can listen to your fullness cues. Pay attention to body signals that tell you you’re no longer hungry
        (you can use the hunger scale for these). Aim to be comfortably full, but avoid getting to the point of feeling stuffed.</p>
        <br>
        <p><h5>Finishing a meal</h5></p>
        <p>Stop eating when you’re around 5 or 6 on the hunger scale, even if that means leaving food on your plate.</p>
        <p>Most of us have been taught from a young age that it’s wasteful to leave food on our plates. While there’s definitely
        validation in this, it’s important to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Yes, it may be wasteful the first
        few times you do this. However, gradually you’ll learn to adjust the amount of food you serve on your plate or reduce
        the quantities that you cook with.</p>
        <p>It may take some time to unlearn the guilt associated with leaving food on your plate, but this will help you to become
        more mindful and in-tune with what your body needs.</p>
