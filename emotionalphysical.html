        <h3>Difference between physical and emotional hunger</h3>
        <p>Emotional hunger is often mistaken for physical hunger, and it can be hard to separate between the two, particularly if you're prone to emotional eating. However, there are certain clues that can help.</p>

        <p>Understanding the difference between physical and emotional hunger can help us better understand why we’re making
        certain food choices, and then learn to control the triggers that lead to these choices.</p>
        <p>If you’ve identified that your hunger is more emotional, rather than physical, what can you do about it?</p>
        <p>When you first experience a craving, try to put off eating anything for five minutes. Don’t tell yourself that you can’t
        eat that food, as this usually results in us wanting the food even more. Instead, just tell yourself that you’re going
        to wait five minutes before eating.</p>
        <p>During these five minutes, get yourself a large glass of water and take a few deep breaths. Take a moment to check in
        with yourself. What emotions are you feeling? If it’s stress, think about some of the other strategies that you’ve used
        in the past which have helped to control stress. This might be taking a walk outside, calling a friend, doing 10 mins of
        meditation, or writing in your journal.</p>
